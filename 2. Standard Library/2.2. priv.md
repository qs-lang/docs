# `priv` (private scoped)
Provides a new layer of abstraction in which you can eassly separate and controll variables with exactly the same name. 
This is extremally usefull since qs21 is **only** globally scoped. Whenever you are defining custom functions, you should
always wrap all it's "local" variables in {priv}.

## Usage example
### example 1:
```
{def> x> 1}
{x}, 
{priv> x> 
  {def> x> 2}
  {x},
}
{x}, 
```
> this evaluates to "1, 2, 1".
> as you can clearly see, scope of `x` was well handled. Redefinition of x, doesn't spread outside {priv}'s scope.

   * Mechanism of action for this function is pretty simple. 
   * all you need to do is to remember values of all scoped
   * variables, then evaluate given expression, and then 
   * restore all of the values.
   *
   * You could probably use some sort of buffer, list or something
   * but you can also capture all of those values in defines, and
   * then use pure qs21 code to restore them. It's actually much
   * simpler this way. 
   *
   * Since we are generating new expression, we will need a string
   * buffer, let's use strb_t

   * Since variable length functions are pain:
   * priv[0 .. priv-len - 2] - names of variables
   * priv[priv-len - 1] - expression

   * all we have to do is to wrap values in defines:
