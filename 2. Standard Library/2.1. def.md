# `def` (define)
Wrapper for `vmem_t * qs_vmem_def (qs_t * self, /*STACK:*/char * name, /*HEAP:*/void * value, void (*cfun)(qs_t *))`, with some extra features.
Provides ability to define custom expressions in **vmem**. Additionaly, creates wrappings around relative arguments, asigning 'em names, providing
higher layer of abstraction.

## Usage example
### example 1:
```
{def> x> 100}
```
> pretty self explanatory.

### example 2:
```
{def> x> y> z}
```
> this will actually create and define (in vmem as `x`) new expression: 
```
{priv> y>
  {def> y: {v> x-0}}
  {z}
}
```
> as you can see, the `y` variable got not only scoped but also assigned the value of relative argument `x-0`, purposefully accessed with `v` - not with simple *call*.
